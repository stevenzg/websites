There are so many good developer sites, just like a sea.

# Websites
Collection of web sites that web developer should know. [Click Me](http://gyf1.com/websites)

# Background
There are already existed some awesome collections, like [js-the-right-way](http://jstherightway.org/) and so on.

However, I want to do some stuff more like bookmarks for web developers.

# Advanced Tools
Firefox Addon

If you want to install this bookmark to Firefox Addons.

You can find the firefox xpi format file [here](https://github.com/GYF1/websites/blob/gh-pages/ff-addon/ff-addon.xpi)
